The 0.3 update (one of the biggest updates), mostly focused on the visual sides, on the creation of the forge and the integration of the modules.

On release, some bugs appeared (as usual), but with your help and your feedback, we were able to fix most of them.

Here come the 0.3.5, which ads a lot of corrections and various things.

##### Highlights of the update:

- FX in game
- Modules lock
- Gamepad restored
- Bug fix 0.3

### Character's skills

Characterâ€™s skills status is now visible in game.
The skill glows in game when it is effective inside the squared icons.

For every skill that is evloving during the match, the number corresponding to the current state on each skill is visible and explicit (for instance using battery skill's of Kalak).

### Progress and balance in the game

Thanks to your feedback, the modules have been balanced and updated.

Moreover, in the 0.3, we intentionally gave everyone every ships in the game so you could test them and give your feedback the quickest way possible.

Now, you will start the game with only 11 modules and you will have to win resources playing.
Then use them to craft new modules in the forge.

The balance of the game is not perfect yet, and we will work on the progression in the game, starting now.

### New operating systems

The game and updates are now available on MAC and Linux.

Please report any troubles you find about a compatibility or running issue!

### Gamepad navigation

Joystick (or keyboard) navigation was a big topic, we made a first version that didn't work very well and turned it off.

From 0.3.5, gamepad and keyboard navigation should be possible on all screens!
We are still improving the navigation to make it faster, in particular with shortcuts.

### Special effects

On the 0.3, as it was a heavy update, we did not have time to focus on special effects.

in this version, we are getting closer to the final version in terms of special effects, but we keep working on them.

##### Here is the list of what has change :

- The ball is now yellow
- Ball apparition in the middle of the arena
- Projectiles explosion when touching the ball
- Projectiles destruction when going on the enemy side
- There are sparks when the ball collides on the side of the arena
- Animation disappearance/appearance of the inhibitor
- The shield of the ship changed, also an indicator showing the number of shields is visible

### Server selection

When you choose a server, the ping is now visible to help you choose.

Also you can now see the region and the ping at the bottom of the screen.
We are still identifying lag problems, so if you encounter any problem, please show your ping during the bugs.

### BUG FIX

- It is now possible to change the enemy preset on local mode
- The music did not run properly when it had to
- The Custom Game Mode was not running properly
- There could be errors when changing game modes
- The server selection wasn't working properly
- The versus screen was not blocking the navigation
- "Rikito", the pilot, was often bugged when combined with certain ships, making him way to strong
- Bug on the navigation in the settings screen
- AI hp was not up to date
- Sometimes, the music was working when the game was minimized, but not when it was open

### Let's talk about the 0.4

You are a lot to ask for it, the 0.4 will be focused on the ranked mode!
Of course other things are planned too, like a system of success, a better progression and a whole tutorial.
The list is not exhaustive, the ranked mode is a huge task taking a lot of resources, but we are so hyped about it (hopefully you too).

See you soon in the arenas!
