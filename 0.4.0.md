### Pongarena becomes Exoblast!

The concept behind Pongarena was created in a really short time more than ten years ago.
Today, a dozen of people are dedicated to make the game better and the means invested are obviously multiplied by ten.
In order to avoid possible legal problems, we prefer to change the name which is in line with a new era for the project.

So make some noise for <b>Exoblast</b>!

### The ranked mode, plus ultra!

A new mode is now available for you to play.

Chose the <b>ranked mode</b> and start to climb the tower to brag by defeating your opponents.

Designed to reward the most relentless players, this mode will allow you to have a visible progression with a rank going from bronze to challenger (bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond and challenger).

At the end of each battle, you will have your win/loss history visible as well as your progression in this mode.

It's time to break the meta and impose your custom ship and playstyle!

### Speed has been increased, unleash your power!

In the last few updates, the game became slower, almost boring at some points.
The speed restriction is now removed!
The ball speed is faster
from the beginning of the game, and the evolution of the ball speed is also increased!

We changed some components and rules to make the game more dynamic and fun while trying to keep under control.

Work on your reflexes pilots, your opponent won't be kind with you.

### Balancing the game

Balancing a game is never an easy thing, specifically when you add a lot of components to craft ships with a lot of freedom.

And so, we added new ship's presets when you start the game.
You now begin the game with a balanced
composition, allowing you to compete with ship types unlocked later in the game.

This balancing allows you to focus on your performance and not the farming.

We are still working a lot on new balance to improve everything, and the next patch will probably bring some modifications, but we think this is a good way to start and new players won't be disadvantaged when fighting online

### New endgame screen

When the game ends, you can now see a lot of informations on the game, you, and your opponent.

You will be able to see the statistics
of the game in the form of a high score, the number of materials unlocked in order to create the modules, the suns points and experience and finally the ships (allies/enemies) with their statistics.

A good way to look at this data, compare your ships and adapt to come back stronger!

### A tutorial for everyone!

From now on, a tutorial has been added to welcome new players and to explain the features that arrived in 0.3 for old players.
The previous tutorial was not enough so we completely reworked it and added informations on other screens.

You will have a gameplay tutorial that will start when you first connect, as well as a tutorial for each screen (main menu, hangar, pilot selection, ship editor, forge and techtree).

Once you finish the gameplay tutorial, you will receive experience and resources as a reward.
Each tutorial can be <b>skipped</b>, however we do not recommend it if this is your first time playing the game.

Enjoy the game!

### A lot of new visuals !

We added two new arenas in the game.
They represent the Bronze and Silver arenas of the ranked mode but are not yet anchored as such until update 0.5.

Once the Gold, Platinum and Diamond arenas are integrated, the first two arenas will be anchored to the corresponding ranks.

Six new skins have been added and are applicable in the forge when you craft a new module.
You can find pigments by winning online games (quick or ranked), those are consumable materials.

### Let me tell you a story

When you select a character, the lore of the character is written.
The evolution of the universe is a topic we would like to address in future updates.
