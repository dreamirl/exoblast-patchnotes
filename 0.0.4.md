Here is the new version 0.0.4 bringing some small features and bug fixes.
We focused on major critical bugs and improvements requested by the players.
The in game menu brings the ability to leave a game or change the settings while playing (adding a menu accessible with escape).
It will pause the game in "local mode" but not in "online" modes.

We also added the possibility to replay the tutorial, from the settings menu.

In this update there are also some interfaces fixes, like the AI settings in the "Local Mode" screen, but we also changed the font, moving some text/components...

On the other side, the 0.1.0
version is coming on the beta branch in a few more days and should be on the "default branch" around the 15th of August.
This major update brings Pilots and servers regions selector.
You can still play against players from all around the world but also deselect servers with a big ping.

We will announce the beta branch update only on the Discord server, please not that this branch is a different server, smaller, so you won't have the same account/progression and it can be wiped at any time.

Don't forget you can see and follow the planning

Many thanks to all the players who are helping and playing every day.
Big up to one player who reached the maximum level on his ship already!
