Dear pilots! Version 0.2.0 is coming soon!
Lately we have been extremely busy. We had to think about a lot of things for the rest of the game while working on the feedback from the players - that's why this update will arrive late.

##### So here is the list of the improvements of this patch (currently planned) :

- Controller integration : It is now possible to navigate in the menus with the controller!
- New server : It was about time! A US server will be deployed, with more smoothness and less lag for North American players.
- Server choice: We decided that it was better to let the players choose the server on which they play - you will be able to change the server on the selection screen.
- MacOS is now supported.

##### Bug hunting season is always open (your feedback really helps us) :

- English translation corrected
- Pilot powers (shield recharging)

##### What we are Currently working on (it won't necessarily be in this next version, though) :

- Preparation of the ranked mode, design of the environment and rewards, management of the matchmaking via player classification.
- Adding a single-player campaign mode. We can't say more right now – we’re taking inspiration from things we like in other games
- Redesign of the ships, laser cutting ! We'd like to add the possibility to create your own ship by combining different parts in unique combinations. It's all up to you!
- Modification of the hangar screen, we'll have to change everything to turn it into a real workshop!
- Complete redesign of all screens and menus, as we didn't think it was intuitive / user-friendly enough.

Thanks for your support and see you soon in the arena.
